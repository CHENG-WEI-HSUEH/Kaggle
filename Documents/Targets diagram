In the project, we're going to find insights behind the data in order to target 
the prospective buyers; Additionally, throught analytical reports, we also need
to provide a reliable marketing strategy.

Now, we've known the business goals; subsequently, we're going to follow the data
mining strategy step by step to create the anaytical reports.

1. Understanding business goals ✓
2. Data identification
3. Data cleaning
4. Data exploration
5. Data presentation
★ Generate an analytical reports including marketing strategies.


2. In this step, we're going to check the data's volume, variety, and varacity.
   2-1.  List the data types, the size of data, and these data's meaning.
   2-2.  Check whether there are duplicated data or missing data.


3. After checking the data, we should remove bad data, organize the raw data,
   and fill in the null values.


4. In data exploration, we're going extract the insights from raw data.
   4-1.  Find the unique values in non-primitive data.
   4-2.  Generate descriptive statistics including maximum, minimum, mean of
         values, and standard deviation.
   4-3.  Find the proportion of each models - find the most popular model
   4-4.  Find the percentage of both male and female customers - do men more

   4-5.  Find the proportion of defferent marital status - do single customers
         more likely buy treadmills than married customers?


5. Finally, the useful information needs to be visualized based on their
   attribution.
   5-1.  List a table including descriptive statistical information.
   5-2.  Show the the proportion of each models, gender, and marital status with
         pie charts.
   5-3.  Create population pyramids by models.
   5-4.  Show the relationship between each data via scatter plots.
   5-5.  Gernerate a heat map of correlation.
   5-6.  Show the disribution of numeric data with bar charts.
